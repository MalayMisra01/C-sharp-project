For my minor project, I developed a Student Course Management System using C# and Windows Forms (WinForms). The project simulates a desktop application that allows users to manage students, courses, enrollments, and grades efficiently. This project demonstrates my understanding and practical application of object-oriented programming (OOP), event-driven programming, and user interface design using C#.

I began by defining core data models using OOP principles. I created three primary classes: Student, Course, and Enrollment. Each class encapsulates related properties and behaviors. For example, the Student class includes methods to calculate GPA based on enrolled courses and assigned grades. These models helped maintain a clean and modular codebase.

Using WinForms, I designed a user-friendly interface that allows for easy data entry and interaction. I implemented features such as dropdown menus to select students and courses, list boxes to display enrollments, and numeric controls for grade input. Event handlers were used extensively to handle user actions like button clicks, selections, and data updates. These ensured the application responded dynamically and accurately to input.

One of the main challenges was updating UI elements in sync with the underlying data structures. I addressed this by refreshing the data sources and views dynamically after each operation. I also ensured data validation to prevent errors such as duplicate entries or missing fields.

Overall, this project allowed me to apply my theoretical knowledge of C# programming in a practical context. It strengthened my skills in class design, collection management, form-based application development, and real-time data handling. Additionally, working with a structured UI framework helped me understand how to build scalable and user-centric applications.
